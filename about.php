<div class="about">
<p>I'm a designer who loves illustration. With each new piece of art, I work to blend design and art, be it through the technique used to create the final images, the application, or just the way I apply design skills to the piece. The work on display in my portfolio doesn't show it, but I've also recently discovered how much I like type and typography, I plan to start exploring illustrative type in the near future. I'm also profficient with alot of the tools and software of our trade, and know how to build websites.  </p>
